# **How to "install" a demo bar**

You first need to have the Sitecore JS library installed on your target website. Use [TM Script](https://github.com/Chris-Castle/Sitecore-CDP-Scripts/blob/master/_TM%20Script/Sitecore%20CDP%20base%20script.user.js)

Then copy and paste the provided code for the demo/data bar into a new Sitecore Web Experience.

Then either "Preview" or set the Experience live.

*Add Page Targeting if you are using a shared environment + setting live*
